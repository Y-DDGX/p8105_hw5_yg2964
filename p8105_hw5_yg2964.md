### Problem 1

Function to simulate birthdays and check for duplicates

``` r
bday_sim = function(n){
bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace=TRUE)

duplicate = length(unique(bdays))<n
return(duplicate)
}
```

Run simulations for group sizes 2 to 50

``` r
sim_res =
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n,bday_sim)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(probability = mean(res))
```

Create visualization

``` r
sim_res |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = probability)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +    # Removed color specification to use viridis default
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Shared Birthdays by Group Size",
    x = "Number of People in Group",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday",
    caption = "Based on 10,000 simulations per group size"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```
